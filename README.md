### Purpose:  
Benchmark Linear, Resursive Binary, and Jump searches on a large sorted list (n = 1000000)  
while also maintaining clean code with pylint and autopep8. Scored on the ability to pass all  
of the provided test cases in test_search.py

### Method:
- Generate a large, sorted list 
- Find the values at the min, mid, and max indexes
- Search for these three values via each algorithm, outputing the returns and run-times
